1. System Requirement<br>​
  1.1 Supported Operating System<br>​
    Tested Version: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS<br>​
    Note: The software has only been validated on the above OS version; compatibility with other operating systems is not guaranteed.<br>​
  1.2 Software Dependencies<br>​
    Programming Language: Python 3.8 (mandatory, exact version required)<br>​
    Required Libraries & Versions:<br>​
    pyDOE == 0.3.8<br>​
    matplotlib == 3.7.1<br>​
    numpy == 1.24.4<br>​
    pandas == 2.0.3<br>​
    torch == 2.0.1<br>​
  1.3 Hardware Requirements<br>​
    Minimum Hardware (for program execution): A standard desktop computer with sufficient RAM (≥8GB) and a multi-core CPU (≥4 cores).<br>​
    Tested Hardware (for model training):<br>​
    CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8380 (2.30GHz, 64 cores)<br>​
    GPU: NVIDIA A100 (80GB)<br>​
    Note: GPU is recommended for model training to accelerate computation; CPU-only execution is supported but may take longer. No non-standard hardware is required.<br>
3. Installation Guide<br>
  2.1 Install Python 3.8<br>
     Download Python 3.8 from the official website <br>
  2.2 Set Up a Virtual Environment<br>
     Create and setup a virtual environment<br>
  2.3 Install Dependent Libraries<br>
     Install libraries via requirements<br>
  2.4 Typical Install Time<br>​
    On a "normal" desktop computer (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM, stable internet connection), the total installation time is 15-25 minutes, including Python installation, virtual environment setup, and library downloads (varies slightly based on internet speed).<br>
4. Demo<br>​
  3.1 Instructions to Run the Demo<br>​
    Prepare Demo Data:<br>​
    The demo comes with pre-packaged sample data.<br>​
    Ensure the data path in the demo program is correctly configured.<br>​
    Run the Demo Program:<br>​
    Activate the virtual environment<br>​​
    Run the demo program:<br>​
​    python demo_case.py<br>
  3.2 Expected Output<br>​
    Result Images: Multiple result pictures generated by matplotlib will be produced.<br>
  3.3 Expected Run Time for Demo<br>
    It is not recommend training the demo on a "normal" desktop computer, while running the plot demo will only cost 1-2 minutes.<br>
4. Instructions for Use<br>
    Only have to change the training data. <br>
